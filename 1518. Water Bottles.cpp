There are numBottles water bottles that are initially full of water. You can exchange numExchange empty water bottles from the market with one full water bottle.

The operation of drinking a full water bottle turns it into an empty bottle.

Given the two integers numBottles and numExchange, return the maximum number of water bottles you can drink.
